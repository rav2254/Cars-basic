Just a basic beginner level HTML project testing my ability to-
-Create pages
-incorporate links
-incorporate images into the webpage
-push the project onto GitHub
-Create good commit messages and follow atomic commit principles



Notes-
Welcome to my first public project. I don't why you'd be reading this but Thank you for looking at my very basic project!
I made this project for the Odin Project HTML assignment.
I went with making a list of my favorite cars instead of a cookie cutter recipe project. 
I wanted to make the page a lot more extensive with many more cars. sorting them by decades, engine size, HP and region but since i am only working with HTML and the project is more about testing the skills i learned so far rather than creating a full fledged website, i decided to leave it at this.

I did have to lookup a few things like using images as a link or centering an image on a page as part of the project that i wasn't taught in my regular lessons but overall it was pretty simple. As far as i understand, using the <!--<center>--> tag is not the most efficient way of doing it but i used it anyways because it worked and it's a basic site anyways.

Might visit this in the future to add more content as i gain more skills but probably not.
