    <h3>Opinion</h3>
    <p>It is widely accepted that a motor vehicle is not a great financial asset. With companies expected to release newer and better version
        of their line-ups every year driving existing models into deeper obsolescence. Top that with regular wear and tear and limited
        life of an engine and you are sure to lose money on your purchase. But the Porsche 911 might be an exception to that rule. 
    </p>
    <p>With a nearly unchanged design since the 70s and an extremely well built car, the Porsche is one of the least appreciating Cars
        on the market. With an average 5-year depreciation of 30% versus 50-60% of comparable cars. On top of that, if you end up getting 
        a limited edition the value might ending up going up in a few years making it an extremely rare appreciating investment in the car world.
    </p>
    <p>With all of this mature finance talk, you might think you are getting yourself into a boring car. Well, think again. The flat-6
        turbo charged engine combined with German precision engineering outputs <strong>480HP</strong>, taking you from 0-60 in 3.3 seconds.
