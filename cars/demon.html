    <h3>Opinion</h3>
    <p>If there was ever an award show for muscle cars, <strong>The Dodge Challenger Demon 170</strong> would sweep the whole night. </p>

    <p>With a 6.2ltr supercharged Hemi V8, the Demon 170 outputs 900HP on premium or to tick it up a few notches you can use E85 
        gas to get a drag ripping <strong>1025HP!!!</strong> 
    </p>
    <p>In iconic muscle style, the Demon doesn't output these crazy numbers using precision manufacturing or an aerodynamically efficient design
        but with pure brute force and a lot of tiny explosions.
    </p>
    <p>To top it all off, Dodge offers drag tires as an add-on when you purchase the Demon for single dollar telling the buyers exactly 
        what the car is built for. 
    </p>

    <p>The Demon currently holds the record for the fastest accelerating production car in the world. The stock demon is actually
        banned from the National Hot Rod Association(NHRA) for having a sub 9 second quarter mile without a roll cage and a parachute.
        Imagine a road legal production car so quick that it cannot participate in the largest drag racing association in the world.

    <h4>R.I.P Demon you were the best sendoff we could hope for, for such an iconic car.</h4>
