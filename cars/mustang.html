    <h3>Opinion</h3>
    <p>The Mustang GT S550 is one of the most versatile cars in the market. It's a perfect fit for a wide range of drivers and enthusiasts: </p>
    <h4>The daily driver</h4>
    <p>Despite it's endless possibilities, you can easily keep the car bone stock with a few aesthetic modifications and you got yourself a daily driver which 
        would still be one of the coolest cars on the road. Even at stock, you still have a 5.0ltr Coyote V8 making around <strong>450HP</strong> which allows you to rip it 
        whenever you get a chance or you can cruise around town enjoying that V8 thump that everyone loves.
    </p>
    <h4>The Drift King</h4>
    <p>Being a rear wheel drive, the Mustang is the perfect car for drifting with a few modifications. With an upgraded suspension
        and brand new brakes, you got yourself a donut king. Just make sure to keep yourself away from the crowds.
    </p>
    <h4>A Drag star</h4>
    <p>The Mustang is like a beast waiting to be unleashed. With regulations, software restrictions, naturally aspirated Engine
        and a heavy body the incredibly capable Coyote V8 can only output 450HP stock(which is still a lot of horses) but with
        a few mods you can truly turn this muscle into a rocket on wheels. With a supercharger kit, upgraded exhaust, cold air intake
        and a carbon fibre kit, you can easily dust a porsche 911 or a Lamborghini on the drag strip. Just make sure to upgrade
        the other parts to be able to handle the <strong>900-1000HP</strong> your upgraded engine is going to output</p>
